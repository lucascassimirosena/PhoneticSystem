# PhoneticSystem
 This is a little piece of software I created to practice the C language while memorizing the Phonetic System.

The Phonetic System is a mnemonic technique that allows one to memorize any number using a system that converts numbers into images.

I have it memorized by heart but to put my knowledge of C language in practice I'll create a system that would help me to memorize it just for the fun.
