First, I'll create the alghorithm itself, thinking and structuring it in a logic way that will help me to build it.

The idea will be the software show a random number OR word that is part of my phonetic system. It will show the random number or word and I must answer it correctly 
according to my own Phonetic System. 

It means that I'll need a rand function that will compare the generated number to a number located in a vector and return the correct or incorrect statement.
